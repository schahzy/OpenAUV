In this section, the models and manufacturers of electronic components used in OpenAUV are described in detail. Please refer to "Bill of Materials.xlsx" for more details.

When purchasing components, developers should select the appropriate model for the availability of their own country or region. At the same time, experienced developers can replace similar products according to their actual needs. i.e. using Nvidia Jetson Nano instead of Jetson Orin.

Developers who have questions about electronic device selection can contact me by Email(schahzy@163.com) at any time:)
