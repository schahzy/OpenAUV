In this part, I show the design diagram and PCB schematic of OpenAUV's energy distribution module.

Since the OpenAUV prototype is 130mm diameter, my PCB layout is a 120mm diameter circle, which can be installed vertically in my cabin.

If you want to use a different diameter hull, or if you want to incorporate more chips on this board, you can refer to the "Schematic diagram of energy distribution" document under this section. This file can be opened using Altium Designer20, which you can link to your component library for quick secondary development!
