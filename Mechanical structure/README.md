This branch contain hardware structure disign of the OpenAUV. Mainly includs 3D model's CAD design.

**Please notice that due to the version of CAD software, current file are all .STEP format to make sure most of developers can open it smoothly. However, the apperance of .STEP is quiet ugly (laking color), you can check the structure size and re-modeling in you own software or just import the model to you software and rendering (may cause some software problems).** (Personally suggesting you open file with solidworks **2023**)

Due to the limit of file size and loading time, all of the electricity components are delated from the structure CAD. You can find out them in electrical prat of this project.
